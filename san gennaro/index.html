    <p>At the intersection of Mulberry and Canal Street on Saturday, September 14, 2024, people of all backgrounds gathered to celebrate the rich heritage of Italy with delicious food and friends at the 98th Annual San Gennaro Parade in New York City. The feast which takes place from September 12th to the 22nd in Little Italy is organized by the Figli di San Gennaro.</p>

    <p>As the floats go down the narrow streets on Mulberry, I encounter many familiar faces along the way. “The Italian Fairy”, Simona Rodano, with her group of dancers entertain the crowds while enjoying a cannoli. This is an iconic moment as this year's theme honors Italian American Culinary Cuisine. Cannoli’s were provided by the world famous “Cannoli King” owner of Caffe Palermo, John DeLutro, known by all as “Baby John.”</p>

    <p>In a truly unforgettable experience, I then make my way aboard the Figli Di San Gennaro float for an exclusive interview with the Vice president of the organization, John Fratta. As a descendent of one of the founders of the feast, Mr. Fratta spoke to us about the mysticism and rich history of San Gennaro.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“San Gennaro is the patron Saint of Naples and he was beheaded in 305 by the Emperor Diocletian... Every year on September 19th, his feast day, his blood goes from powder form, to blood, to liquid and bubbles up... The last time it didn’t liquify was the beginning of World War II.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Mr. Fratta’s expression of devotion to his faith is powerful as he shares the mysticism and rich history of San Gennaro. As we approach our final destination aboard the float, we reach the Church of the Most Precious Blood, the National Shrine of San Gennaro. At the church, I have the pleasure to continue discussing the powerful devotion of faith in our culture with Monsignor Jaimie Gigantiello. Stay tuned for part 2 of our coverage of the San Gennaro feast next week as Msgr. Jamie and I discuss two pillars that are the embodiment of Italian culture: faith and food.</p>
